                  <p>eXpOS stands for eXperimental Operating System. The <a href="os_spec.html" target="_blank">eXpOS
                      specification</a> describes a very simple multi-user multi-tasking operating system. </p>
                  <p>eXpOS is not intended to be used as a practical operating system. It is designed with the
                    following intentions:
                    <ol>
                      <li>To have a multi-tasking OS specification that can be comprehended by a junior undergraduate
                        student in computer science who is undergoing a first course in Operating System such that
                        he/she will be able to implement the OS in two or three months. This educational package comes
                        with enough guidance and support tools as well as documentation to allow the student to achieve
                        this goal without the supervision of a specialist teacher.</li>
                      <li>The student will write the complete code for the OS from scratch. He/She will not be building
                        the OS on top of a given code base. The only programming support provided will be a compiler
                        for a programming language (called SPL) in which the OS kernel will be written. </li>

                  <p>If you are a non-expert in computer science – like an undergraduate student or some non-specialist
                    systems enthusiast – and you have a basic understanding of programming, and computer organization,
                    implementing eXpOS will help you to get a feel of some of the core ideas involved in implementing a
                    multi-tasking operating system on a single processor. You will learn how to:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Initally load the operating system from secondary storage to memory – <b>Bootstrapping</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Manage several processess in memory simultaneously – <b>Process Management</b>. </li>
                    <li>Handle allocation and de-allocation of memory to processes – <b>Memory Management</b> (includes
                      virtual memory management). </li>
                    <li>Manage organization of data and program files in secondary storage – <b>File Management</b>.</li>
                    <li>Implement a mechanism to allow multiple processes to share files/memory – <b>Resource Sharing</b>.</li>
                    <li>Realize primitives that help application programs to avoid inconsistency when resources are
                      shared by several processes executing concurrently – <b>Process Sychronization</b>.</li>
                    <li>Handling multiple users with different privileges over resources shared among them – <b>Multi-user
                        Capability.</b></li>
                  </ol><br />
                  <p>The experiment is akin to guiding a third year aerospace engineering student to build a small
                    unmanned flight in two months. (The flight will not be usable outside the laboratory!)</p>

                  <p>The project presumes that the student has undergone a basic sophomore course in computer
                    organization and data structures and has either completed or is currently undergoing a theory
                    course in operating systems. The project does not require the student
                    to be familar with the principles of compilers. It is not expected that the student has a high
                    level of proficiency in programming or computer hardware. The required background on paging
                    hardware, interrupts, run­time stack of application programs etc. are provided as reading material

                  <p>People who want to learn about operating systems, but who belong to the following category are not
                    advised to proceed with eXpOS:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>You are a confident programmer comfortable with reading and understanding professionally
                      written code – like the source code of linux. In this case, more sophisticated packages like <a
                        href="http://minix3.org/">Minix</a> allow you to do real hard stuff. However, this is not for
                      novices. </li>
                    <li>You are not an expert; you want to try out the things listed in FAQ 2, but you do not want to
                      do dirty work at a low level. (Although you can avoid assembly language programming in the eXpOS
                      project, you still will have to get into quite a bit of “low level” architectural details). We
                      suggest you to look for alternatives like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Completely_Heuristic_Operating_System"

                  <p>What you learn is very little compared to what is needed to become an OS expert. So, listing out
                    everything is impossible. But here are some important misses: </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The XSM machine allows you to store a character string in a memory word. No real machine
                      architecture permits you to do such stuff. This is made possible just because XSM is a software
                      simulated. However, XSM makes your data manipulation job much simpler without getting bogged down
                      by details of data formatting. It is in principle possible to implement eXpOS on “more real”
                      machines like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set" target="_blank">MIPS</a>.
                      However, this would involve considerably more time and effort. </li>
                    <li>The project involves very little work involving input-ouput, device interfacing, security or
                      networking. Moreover the file system and multi-user support are very primitive. The methods
                      studied won't scale up when there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking#Preemptive_multitasking"

                    packages like NACHOS?</b></a>
                <div id="collapse10" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                  <p>It is difficult to answer this question for all similar packages available elsewhere, but here is
                    a comparison with NACHOS. </p>
                  <p>NACHOS learning system asks you to implement OS software that allows application programs in the
                    noff executable format, running on a the software simulation of a MIPS machine, to invoke system
                    calls. However, the OS code you write really doesn't run on the MIPS machine! Your code is actually
                    C code running on your Linux/Unix machine. When an application program invokes an OS system call,
                    the MIPS simulator transfers control to a corresponding “stub” function in the simulating
                    environment. You must write C code in the stub to do “whatever is expected from the OS” to satisfy
                    the calling application program invoking the system call. Since the MIPS machine is simulated, your
                    code has access to its memory, registers etc. Thus you can implement the system call, put return
                    values in appropriate memory locations on the simulated MIPS machine and transfer control back to
                    the calling program. </p>
                  <p>In eXpOS, the OS and the application programs run in the same machine as is the case in real
                    systems. The compromise made in achieving this goal was to make the machine “unreal” and the OS
                    simple enough so that additional complexity is manageable for a short term project. </p>

                  <p><a href="http://xosnitc.github.io/" target="_blank">XOS</a> is an earlier version of this project.
                    XOS did not support blocking system calls.</p>
                  <p> This means that a process will never do a context switch while it is running in the kernel mode.
                    However eXpOS, system calls may block in the kernel mode and other processes could be scheduled.
                    The version of XSM provided with eXpOS has the necessary hardware support for doing this.</p>
                  <p> The addition of this single feature makes the eXpOS substantially more complex than XOS. This is
                    because a blocked process might have made partial updates to some OS data structures before
                    blocking and a newly scheduled process, while executing in the kernel mode, must be careful not to
                    modify these data structures and leave the OS in an inconsistent state. </p>
                  <p> Apart from the above feature, eXpOS adds support for semaphores, shared memory, file locking etc.
                    There is also limited multi-user support. However, the additional complexity introduced by these
                    features is minor. </p>

                  <p>You have to write your OS code from your Linux/Unix system in a custom programming language called

                    disk of the XSM machine. The xfs-interface tool allows you to do this pre-loading. Your OS code
                    must include set up code that will be executed when the system is started. This code must load the
                    rest of the OS into memory during bootstrap. </p>

                <div id="collapse14" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                  <p>In a multitasking OS like Linux, there are two types of programs running. Firstly, there are
                    application programs that users write. These are called "user mode programs". Secondly, there are
                    "kernel mode programs" which constitute the OS code. These routines implement the system call
                    interface for application programs and other OS functions like process, memory, file and device
                    management etc. </p>
                  <p>User mode programs can execute only a restricted instruction set and has access only to a limited
                    memory (called the virtual address space). These programs must invoke OS system calls to do tasks
                    which involve capacity beyond their limited instruction set. Kernel mode programs on the other hand
                    have full access to the machine instruction set. </p>
                  <p>Any machine supporting eXpOS needs to recognize and support two modes of program execution. The OS
                    must be designed such that the machine switches to kernel mode when a user mode program invokes a
                    system call and goes back to user mode when the system call returns. This requires architecture
                    support. XSM machine is equipped with the necessary hardware support. </p>

                <div id="collapse15" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                  <p>We need separate programming systems for writing user mode programs and kernel mode programs
                    because these languages serve different purposes. The high level language - ExpL provided with the
                    package can be used for writing application programs that run on top of the operating system.
                    However, ExpL does not support low level programming necessary to write the OS. The SPL language
                    (which is essentially an enriched XSM assembly language) must be used to write the OS modules.</p>
